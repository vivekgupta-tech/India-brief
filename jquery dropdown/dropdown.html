The legs of the figure are bent double, heel to heel, and toes turned downwards. His arms are outstretched, and the hands are resting on his knees. From the wrist to the shoulders, the arms are covered with bangles. He is wearing triangular necklaces and crowning his head with a pair of horns meeting in a tall headdress. There is an elephant, a tiger on his exact right, and a rhinoceros, a man, and a buffalo on his left and on the top of the seal, there is an inscription of seven characters..</p>

    <div class="text">
        <p><b> The Gujarāt woodwork</b>, architectural carving executed in the state of Gujarāt in India. Gujarāt was the chief centre of wood carving in India from at least the 15th century. Even when stone as a building material was handled with great ease and confidence, the people of Gujarāt continued to use wood freely in the construction of temple pavilions and in the richly carved facades, balconies, doors, columns, brackets, and grilled windows of residential buildings.</p>
        <br><p>Wood carving in Gujarāt in the Mughal period (1556–1707) shows a happy synthesis of the indigenous and Mughal styles. Jaina wooden pavilions of the late 16th and 17th centuries are richly sculptured with scenes from Jaina mythology and contemporary life and with imaginative floral, animal, and geometrical motifs; figural sculpture has a great vivacity and rhythm. Application of a rich red lacquer to the wood was common. Many sumptuous wooden facades of the 19th century have been preserved, but the ornamentation lacks the grace and movement of earlier work.</p>

    <div class="text">
        <p><b> According to Buddhist doctrine</b>, the universe is the product of karma, the law of the cause and effect of actions, according to which virtuous actions create pleasure in the future and nonvirtuous actions create pain. The beings of the universe are reborn without beginning in six realms: as gods, demigods, humans, animals, ghosts, and hell beings. The actions of these beings create not only their individual experiences but the domains in which they dwell. The cycle of rebirth, called samsara (literally “wandering”), is regarded as a domain of suffering, and the ultimate goal of Buddhist practice is to escape from that suffering. The means of escape remains unknown until, over the course of millions of lifetimes, a person perfects himself, ultimately gaining the power to discover the path out of samsara and then compassionately revealing that path to the world.</p>

The statue was about 110 feet tall and depicted a male figure, standing upright and naked as was typical of Greek sculptures of gods34. The Colossus was likely adorned with a crown or a spiked headpiece to represent rays of the sun, embodying the god's solar attributes4.</p>

It is known for its superb reliefs, which are among the world’s finest examples of narrative sculpture.</p>
        <br><p>The Amarāvatī stupa was begun about 200 BC and underwent several renovations and additions. One of the largest stupas built in Buddhist India, it was about 160 feet (50 m) in diameter and 90 to 100 feet (about 30 m) high, but it has been largely destroyed, much of the stone having been used by local contractors during the 19th century to make lime mortar. Many of the surviving narrative reliefs and decorative plaques are in the Government Museum, Madras, and the British Museum.</p>

    <div class="text">
        <p>The Namaste is one of the most popular Indian customs and isn't just restricted to the Indian territory anymore. You have Barack Obama, who has been seen doing it on various occasions, or you had Ban Ki-Moon, the UN Secretary-General, greeting everyone with a namaste at the Times Square in New York on the first International Yoga Day.</p>

           <p> <br><b>But, what's the significance?</b>
         <br>  <br> The Namaste, or namaskar, or 'namaskar' is one of the five forms of traditional greetings mentioned in the ancient Hindu scriptures, the Vedas. It translates to 'I bow to you', and greeting one another with it is a way of saying 'May our minds meet', indicated by the folded palms placed before the chest. The word Namaha can also be translated as 'na ma' (not mine), to signify the reductions of one's ego in the presence of the other.</p>

Vishnu’s vahana, his vehicle in the world, is the eagle Garuda; his heaven is called Vaikuntha.</p>
